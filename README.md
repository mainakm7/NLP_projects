1. Hidden Markov Model for Parts of Speech tagging

    Using HMM algorithm using the Pomegranate library, every word from a sentence was tagged with appropriate Parts of Speech.

2. Sequence to sequence translation

    Different RNN models were trained to efficiently translate English sentences to Spanish. Many RNN architechtures were explored to empirically determine which works best for sentence translation.
